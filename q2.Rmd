## Fun with Leaflet

This map is using the `leaflet.extras` library to cluster taxi availability in Singapore around the 1st of January 2018, at 06:00. This provides the `addGeoJSONv2` method which enables us to use GeoJSON objects and clustering together.

```{r leaflet}
url <- 'https://api.data.gov.sg/v1/transport/taxi-availability?date_time=2018-01-01T06%3A00%3A00'
library(rjson)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
d <- fromJSON(file=url)
leaflet() %>% setView(lng=103.8, lat=1.3667, zoom=10) %>% addTiles() %>% addGeoJSONv2(d, clusterOptions=markerClusterOptions())

```
